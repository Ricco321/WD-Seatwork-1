## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->

This project is the first seatwork for the course, focused on creating a basic single-page website that includes properly structured headers and footers. The goal is to demonstrate an initial understanding of webpage layout and structure using fundamental web development tools.

The main purpose of this project is to showcase the student's understanding of HTML and CSS, specifically how to create and style essential webpage sections such as the header and footer. This exercise serves as a foundation for more advanced web design tasks in the future.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
